			<p>This is a monitoring system that can be used by children in schools, even in the poorest 
				communities/ schools, to report on the condition of their WASH facilities. </p>
			<p>Simply by dealing with this issue, it raises awareness among students on the condition of 
				their WASH facilities. </p>
			<p>The interactive part of it allows them to engage more and increase the pressure on the 
				school management to keep the facilities in place</p>
